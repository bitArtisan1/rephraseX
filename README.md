# rephraseX-Automatic-Twitter-Posting-Bot

This project automates the process of downloading images and videos from Twitter and posting rephrased tweets using the Claude AI API. It also includes progress tracking for media downloads and directory organization.

## Overview
This repository provides scripts to scrape media (images and videos) from Twitter, rephrase tweets using the Claude API, and post them on Twitter. Additionally, it offers features like progress tracking for media downloads and the ability to organize content into specific directories.

## Features
- **Image and Video Scraping from Twitter:** Download images and videos from tweet URLs.
- **Rephrase Tweets:** Use Claude AI to automatically rephrase tweets before posting them.
- **Progress Tracking for Downloads:** Shows real-time progress bars for media downloads.
- **Organized Storage:** Automatically creates directories based on usernames and media types.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles errors such as missing media or failed API requests.
- **Rate Limiting:** Includes delays to avoid hitting Twitter's rate limits during automation.

To interact with the Twitter API, you'll need API keys from your Twitter Developer account. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Twitter Developer Account:**
   - Go to [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/) and sign in.
   - Apply for a developer account by filling in the required information.

2. **Create a New App:**

   - Click "Create App" and follow the steps to set up your app.
   
3. **Generate API Keys:**
   - In your appâ€™s settings, navigate to "Keys and Tokens."
   - Copy your **Consumer Key**, **Consumer Secret**, **Access Token**, and **Access Token Secret**.

## Obtaining Claude API Keys
Claude is a powerful AI developed by Anthropic that can rephrase text. To use it, you need API keys:

1. **Sign Up for Anthropic API Access:**
   - Visit [Anthropic API](https://www.anthropic.com/) and sign up.
   
2. **Obtain an API Key:**
   - After registering, you will receive access to the Claude API. Retrieve your API key from the API dashboard.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Twitter Developer API keys
- Claude API keys from Anthropic
- Selenium for image scraping (optional, if you want to scrape images)
