## Usage

### 1. Add Twitter Authentication Details

You can either store your Twitter username and password in the `.env` file or provide them directly as command-line arguments when running the scraper.

#### Option 1: Storing credentials in `.env`

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    CONSUMER_KEY=your-consumer-key
    CONSUMER_SECRET=your-consumer-secret
    ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-access-token-secret
    CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
    TWITTER_USERNAME=your-twitter-username
    TWITTER_PASSWORD=your-twitter-password
    ```

3. After configuring the `.env` file, run the following command to scrape tweets:

    ```bash
    python scraper.py -t {number_of_tweets} -u {username}
    ```

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    python scraper.py -t 5 -u elonmusk
    ```

#### Option 2: Providing credentials as command-line arguments

Alternatively, you can provide your Twitter username and password directly in the command when running the scraper:
